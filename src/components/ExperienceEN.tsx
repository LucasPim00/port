        I don't yet have professional experience in the programming market, but I'm constantly learning and improving my skills.
        I'm looking for my first opportunity to apply my knowledge, collaborate with teams, and grow alongside the challenges of the real world of technology.
        <br></br>
        My goal is to build a career as a developer, starting on real projects and continually evolving as a professional.
        I intend to work on technology teams, learn from the day-to-day challenges, and eventually specialize in FullStack development.
